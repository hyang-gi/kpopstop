        </h2>
        <p class="article-extract long-text">K-Pop's star-makers YG Entertainment have got a brand new headquarters –
          a piece of futuristic office architecture to match their impressive ability to have their fingers on the
          global cultural pulse, when it comes to musical talent and chart-topping successes. The building, now the
          home of these giants in the world-famous South Korean music scene, comes courtesy of Dutch architecture
          practice UNStudio and sits in Seoul's Mapo district, next to Yanghwa Bridge and the green island of Seonyudo
          Park. </p>

        </h2>
        <p class="article-extract long-text">It’s not every day that an architect designs a building with hordes of
          quaking K-pop fans in mind – and for Ben van Berkel and the architecture studio he co-founded, that day
          still hasn’t entirely come.“The building is very secure,” he says. “No public access is allowed in
          general.”In fact, the most any unofficial visitor might see at the new YG Entertainment headquarters in the
          South Korean capital, Seoul, is a flash of gorgeously styled hair as Big Bang or perhaps Blackpink flit
          between limousine and lobby. </p>

        </h2>
        <p class="article-extract long-text">SM Entertainment said Tuesday that it will open a flagship store
          Kwangya@Seoul on Nov. 15.

          Located inside the D-Tower building in Seongdong District, eastern Seoul, Kwangya@Seoul will sell its
          artists' albums and merchandise.

          "The store has a futuristic design which recreates the metaverse, where real and virtual worlds coexist,"
          said the agency. It said that it collaborated with LG Display to create a space inside the store created
          with clear OLED display panels. </p>

        </h2>
        <p class="article-extract long-text"> K-pop, which is short for Korean popular music, is a genre that wields a
          power few in the world experience. Consider the fact that in 2020, K-pop contributed over $5 billion to the
          South Korean gross domestic product (GDP), while also garnering more than 1.8 billion views on a single
          YouTube music video (as BLACKPINK's song DDU-DU DDU-DU did). And it’s because of this unfathomable stardom
          that K-Pop’s biggest bands—BLACKPINK and Big Bang—need a bigger and better central hub to outsource their
          precious commodity around the globe.</p>

        </h2>
        <p class="article-extract long-text">The South Korean music scene, otherwise known as K-Pop, is currently
          making huge strides in the global music industry. Popular with fans from Asia to the Americas, South Korean
          bands are currently topping the charts and selling out stadiums. With its fingers on the cultural pulse and
          a social-media-savvy fandom, K-pop is currently taking the world by storm. In 2017 YG Entertainment, the
          producers of K-Pop invited UNStudio to design their brand new headquarter building in Seoul, which since
          completion has become a site of pilgrimage for fans hoping to catch a glimpse of their latest idols. </p>

        </h2>
        <p class="article-extract long-text">YG Entertainment began planning the new structure in 2017, with the help
          of designers at UNStudio. As a result, they hope to draw in K-pop fans hoping to spot their favorite artists
          coming and going from the recording studios and meeting rooms in the building. UNStudio modeled the new
          headquarters after the music industry vibe. It’s ultra-modern, sleek and futuristic. Yet, the building is
          oriented to take advantage of views of the park outside one side and landscaped spaces throughout the inside
          the structure. </p>
